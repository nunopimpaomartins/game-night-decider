import asyncio
from src.bot.handlers import create_poll
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock

# Simple test script to run create_poll logic locally if possible
# BUT handlers require Telegram Update/Context objects which are hard to mock fully in a script script without a framework.
# Instead, I'll rely on reading code.
# The code view will happen in parallel.
